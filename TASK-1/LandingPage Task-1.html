      <ul>
        <li>
          Feature 1:
          <p>
            Durability: A product may be designed to withstand wear and tear
            over time, which could be a key feature for customers who want to
            invest in a long-lasting item.<br />
            For example, a phone case made from high-quality materials that can
            protect a phone from damage if it's dropped could be marketed on its
            durability.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Feature 2-
          <p>
            Versatility: A product may be able to serve multiple purposes or be
            used in a variety of settings. This could be a valuable feature for
            customers who want to get the most out of their purchase.<br />
            For example, a kitchen gadget that can be used for multiple tasks
            (like a blender that can also chop vegetables and make dough) could
            be marketed on its versatility.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Feature 3-
          <p>
            Ease of use: A product may be designed with a user-friendly
            interface or features that make it easy for customers to understand
            and operate. This could be an important selling point for customers
            who want a hassle-free experience.<br />
            For example, a smart speaker that can be controlled by voice
            commands could be marketed on its ease of use.
